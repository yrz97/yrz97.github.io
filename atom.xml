Each siRNA is unwound into two single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs), the passenger strand and the guide strand. The passenger strand is degraded and the guide strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The most well-studied outcome is post-transcriptional gene silencing, which occurs when the guide strand pairs with a complementary sequence in a messenger RNA molecule and induces cleavage by Argonaute 2 (Ago2), the catalytic component of the RISC.

Fig 6C</li></ol><p><strong>conclusin</strong>: Sgo1 overexpression is able to delay the occurrence of MG132-induced cohesion fatigue</p><p>4.Studies have shown that Sgo1 overexpression is able to delay the occurrence of MG132-induced cohesion fatigue $\rightarrow$ overexpression of Myc-Sgo1 WT or ΔSET both rescued MG132-induded cohesion fatigue, but no significant deference between them was observed, although ΔSET seemingly did so better than WT.</p><p>5.The Sgo1–cohesin interaction is required for Sgo1 localization to the inner centromere. If SET functions to inhibit the Sgo1–cohesin interaction, SET depletion would prevent the removal of Sgo1 from inner centromeres; on the contrary, SET overexpression would promote this process</p><ul><li>examine Sgo1 localization only in chromosomes with intact centromeric cohesion could minimize this caveat, because in a portion of these chromosomes, Myc-Scc1 was still retained at inner centromeres even though Sgo1 had been relocated to kinetochores: Fig. S4 F</li><li>In the absence of MG132 treatment, Sgo1 predominantly localized at inner centromeres in the majority of the chromosomes of mock and siSET cells,At 2h and 4 h after MG132 treatment, Sgo1 localized at kinetochores in less cells in si-SET cells than mock cells:Fig 6 D,E</li><li>to further prove this,examined Sgo1 localization on chromosomes with intact centromeric cohesion in cells overexpressing SET $\rightarrow$ overexpression of SET WT triggered more Sgo1 localization to kinetochores than mock treatment,but the Sgo1 binding–deficient mutant SET 3K failed to do so:Fig 6F</li></ul><p><strong>conclusion</strong>:SET, by directly binding to Sgo1, may promote the removal of Sgo1 from inner centromeres.

In vitro CENP-A nucleosomes themselves present a greater barrier to transcription than H3 nucleosomes and might promote their own recruitment.<br><em>[CRM]:Cis-regulatory modules are DNA sequence elements that have transcriptional regulatory activity.
